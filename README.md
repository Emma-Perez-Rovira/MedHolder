# MedHolder
An emergency med holder in case you forget to take your meds.
It is designed for three ellipses, two 12 by 7s, and a smaller one. However, it can be scaled up or down to fit any meds.
I would recommend that you add a bit of cotton fluff inside, as you don't want to open it the day you need it and find that your meds are now dust.
